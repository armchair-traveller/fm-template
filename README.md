# Frontend Mentor template

This template's objective is to provide a quick and easy starting point for all my frontend mentor challenges. Avoid decision paralysis, busy work, and get down to what really matters: Getting obliterated by those challenges. It features all the improvements (boilerplate, utils, tech) I've developed with each consecutive project.

## Usage

```shell
npx degit clone armchair-traveller/fm-template
```

## Overview

Config and tech stack is subject to change, any major tech changes will create a new version right before starting a new challenge.

Releases are tagged by semantic version description e.g. `num`-`tech` 1-svelte-kitpages, 2-react-nextcel

README tracks current tech details that're not mentioned as a package, as well as additional required config (like global names, styles, and variables, unless it has a TODO to mark it).

## Base required files

Most files are subject to change. Only the README and `.node-version` are stack agnostic, thus' they're the ones that should really be kept if starting fresh.

## Guidelines

Covers boilerplate config and challenge guidelines.

- Every challenge must be in a new repository, as maintaining improvements & specific project config across challenges is very difficult. Greenfield projects for each allows you to take advantage of the latest tech.
- Naming convention of each challenge: fm-`#`-`challenge-name` to keep track of challenge
  - If notes are made, please place in README of challenge. Boilerplate README should also be improved for each challenge so that less setup context is needed.

TODO: Add more README boilerplate so that new challenges also get a boilerplate README (is preserved) reflecting the current tech used for the challenge.

TODO:
**Below this line lies my README template, delete all of the above for any challenges!**

TODOs are present whereever things need to be edited or removed on challenge completion.

---

TODO: Copy paste name of challenge header and description from top of `README-template.md`
