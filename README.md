# Frontend Mentor template

This template's objective is to provide a quick and easy starting point for all my frontend mentor challenges. Avoid decision paralysis, busy work, and get down to what really matters: Getting obliterated by those challenges. It's effective.

## Usage

```shell
npx degit clone armchair-traveller/fm-template
```

## Overview

Config and tech stack is subject to change, branches are used as backups of old versions; any adjustments will create a new branch when starting a new challenge.

Semantic version description per branch by `num`-`tech` e.g. 1-svelte-packify, 2-react-nextcel

README tracks current tech details that're not mentioned as a package.

## Tech

- Using snowpack without a router. Creating additional pages will require copy+pasting quite a bit... Luckily, most challenges do not require additional pages.
